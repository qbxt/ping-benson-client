### Quickstart
1) Download and install [Go](https://golang.org)
2) Clone this repo
3) Edit `constants/token-example.go` by renaming it to `token.go` and filling the token Jeff gave you
4) Either `go run main.go` or `go build` and run the executable

### TODO
Make a release so you don't have to install Go
